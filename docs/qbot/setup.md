## üåµ Create a repl.it account.
First step is to create an account at [https://repl.it](https://repl.it). To do this, head to [https://repl.it/signup](https://repl.it/signup) and sign up.

## ‚ûï Create the qbot repl and download qbot on it.
Once you've created an account at repl.it signed in to it, head to the home page at [https://repl.it/~](https://repl.it/~) and select "new repl" at the top right.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/6f69e635af6a4d778702a72e40548039.png)

Then set the language to "Nodejs" and click on "Create Repl".

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/044630fb8d346bc4ae2a486430e7e031.gif)

Right click in the editor and click on "Command Palette". Then search and select "Open Shell".

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/bdf5f8fc51237b01df9fbca76ecf4c28.gif)

Next, download qbot to your project in the shell (the bottom right of the screen) with `git clone https://github.com/yogurtsyum/qbot.git`.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/37cf742b03fd8618e5e4b5fe3e9c4686.gif)

Move the qbot files out of the qbot folder and instead into the main app directory with `mv ./qbot/* ./`.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/67dab69142c26c75ee18f7e00c41d9f0.gif)

Finally, delete the unnecessary qbot folder by clicking the 3 dots to the right of the qbot folder under "Files" and selecting "Delete". When prompted, confirm deleting the folder by clicking "Yes, delete this folder".

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/f215e2c2aefd11498092ea24a3a33505.gif)

Congratulations! You have officially installed qbot onto your repl. Continue with the instructions below to set it up.

## üöÄ Start editing the config.
To do this, head to the "Secrets (Environment variables)" tab in the sidebar, and fill out a value using the instructions below for each of these keys:

* token
* prefix
* cookie
* groupId
* maximumRank
* logchannelid
* shoutchannelid

### üîë token
To find this, head to https://discordapp.com/developers and login with Discord (if prompted to). Then click New Application at the top right. 

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/7d2119ba9f7dd9396c976b3a14d0e293.png)

Pick an application name. This can be anything, like "(group name) Ranking Bot". 

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/02a7c670e1edf6de136512a380581043.png)

Click "Create" after you picked the name.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/b749bc0e59dc15e2f91f36ef3225f436.png)

Now you are on your application's setting page. Click Bot on the side. 

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/db62b68cf165fe00cee73372245e35f4.png)

At the top right, click Add Bot.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/6a9f92e47cedebc803ab886a68807bd4.png)

Then click Yes, do it. 

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/2bb4da3f0e990fa3e0471792076e0e40.png)

You now have a bot account! Now make sure you **disable** Public Bot so only you can add the bot to a server.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/f18e30f510204a91f8f36b72553b749a.png)

The next step you have to do is copy the token. To do this, click Copy under Click to Reveal Token.

Please note that by sharing this with qbot, you are giving the qbot code full access to the bot account you just created. Never share your token with anyone! It gives them full access to your bot account. 

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/a6f0d065d94470b965b7e36fc4eb144f.png)

### üè∑Ô∏è prefix
What do you want to be the prefix for your commands? It can be anything.

### üç™ cookie
To find this, you need to create a bot account at https://roblox.com in an incognito tab (because logging out invalidates the cookie) and give it a rank that can manage roles in your group. Then, right click anywhere and click Inspect Element or Inspect. At the top of the code that popped u you will see some tabs like Elements and Console. For this, you will need to go to Application. If you don't see it, click the >> and then Application. Then, on the left side of the Inspect Element popup, click the arrow by Cookies. Then, select https://web.roblox.com - you will then see some information. Next, copy the value of .ROBLOSECURITY.

Please note that by sharing this with qbot, you are giving the qbot code full access to the bot account you just created. Next, do not log out of Roblox. Simply close the tab. Once you start qbot, you will be automatically logged out of the bot account. Never share your cookie with anyone! It gives them full access to your bot account.

### üç≠ groupId
To find this, go to your group page and copy the small string of numbers in the link.
### üî¢ maximumRank
What do you want the maximum rank number that qbot can rank to, to be? It can't be above the Roblox bot's rank number.
### üìú logchannelid
If you don't want a log channel, type "false". Otherwise, follow the following instructions to set a log channel.  
To do this you will need to first enable Developer Mode if it isn't already by first going into User Settings.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/29406bfb9a428854639d53f002994901.png)

Then go to Appearance on the left sidebar.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/6562a46e4197ea4964af2f994345dd15.png)

Next, enable "Developer Mode" at the bottom.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/b8d0de9060355795217428558bd3a6c3.png)

Next, exit out of settings right click on the channel you'd like qbot to log ranking actions in and click Copy ID.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/185225fded6e3a7eeba6936c08ebc46f.png)
### üì£ shoutchannelid
Follow the same instructions as the previous step "What is the Discord log channel ID?", but instead of right clicking the ranking log channel, right click the channel you'd like qbot to log shout messages in.

## üö™ Invite your bot.
Inviting the bot is easy. Just head back to the application page on [https://discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers) and click OAuth2 on the side. 

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/e043e1c5049226c972960c5bb299c399.png)

Then, if you scroll down you will see Scopes and a ton of check boxes. Check the "bot" box so there is a check mark in the box.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/3ada0791a75b28ed02336db0c04cc58c.png)

Then scroll down to "Bot Permissions" and select the permissions you would like the bot to have. Note that if you don't give the bot the "Administrator" permission, you will need to make sure the bot has access to the channel that it has to respond to commands in.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/d4ad6d95a2e25709df74bfdbc58df8ca.png)

Next, you can look at the bottom of scopes and head to the link it shows to invite the bot.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/f6b1136836d4c87005f802e65dda5e3e.png)

Once you head to that link, you will be prompted to choose what Discord server you would like to add your bot to.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/7b7e2551a01c01f950880ba23c37d809.png)

Click "Continue" once you choose the server:

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/6c1ac2abd4fb13e02b644a887cab2bd0.png)

Confirm the permissions you are giving the bot and click "Authorize" to add the bot to your server.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/fe8a80f1a07c5b9b2fe1ee0e977fc26b.png)

The bot is now in your server!

## üåÖ Launch the bot
You can launch the bot by clicking "Run" at the top middle of the repl but it will go offline soon if you don't do the next step.

![Example](https://i.gyazo.com/0b631c59136018fe351e6bd33705ad0c.gif)

## üõèÔ∏è Setting up UptimeRobot
To set up UptimeRobot, head to [https://uptimerobot.com/](https://uptimerobot.com/) and create an account or sign in. Then head to the dashboard. Select "Add New Monitor" at the top left and set "Monitor Type" to "HTTP(s)". You can set the "Friendly Name" to anything, although to be more organized, we recommend setting it to your bot's name.

Set the "URL (or IP)" to this: `https://PROJECT_NAME--USERNAME.repl.co`. Replace the `PROJECT_NAME` in the URL with your repl's name (can be located at the near top left of the page). Replace the `USERNAME` in the URL with your repl.it username (chosen when you signed up).

On the right, under "Select Alert Contacts To Notify", you can optionally choose a way for UptimeRobot to notify you if the bot goes offline. Then, click "Create Monitor".

## üéâ Congratulations! qbot has been setup!
Congratulations! You just set up an instance of qbot for yourself. Now, go test it out! If you encounter any issues, please do not hesitate to join our support server and ask for support. We will be happy to help you resolve the issue.  
Support Server: https://discord.gg/J47m7t4

## üéÆ Optional: Change your bot's activity.
You can change your bot's activity by editing the `bot-status.json` file. First replace the `false` to `true` on the second line to enable the activity feature under the `activity` option. Then you can replace the `PLAYING` on the third line under the `activitytype` option to either `PLAYING`, `STREAMING`, `LISTENING`, or `WATCHING`. Then change the `Roblox` on the fourth line under the `activitytext` option to the activity text (playing ...). Finally, (only if you set `activitytype` to `STREAMING`) change the `https://twitch.tv/roblox` on the fifth line under the `activityurl` option to the URL of the Twitch stream.

## üî® Discord API TOS
Please note that Discord has a TOS for its API: [https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal)

This TOS is being updated August 15th, 2020 and will require all bots to have a privacy policy (even if it just says you don't collect personal information and has a way to contact you with any privacy concerns). qbot does not have this built in so you will need to add this yourself. 

More info can be found on the [Discord Developers](https://discord.gg/discord-developers) server in [this](https://discord.com/channels/613425648685547541/697489244649816084/728031320625905794) message.
